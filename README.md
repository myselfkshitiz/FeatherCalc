# FeatherCalc 🧮

A modern, native Android calculator built with **Kotlin** and **Material 3**, engineered for robust mathematical accuracy and superior stability in handling complex user interactions.

## ✨ Features & Highlights

* **Logic Resilience:** Engineered to prevent crashes from common state errors, such as continuous operation after a `Division by Zero` error.
* **Accurate Arithmetic Engine:** Supports complex expressions, including correct handling of **implicit multiplication** (e.g., `2(3+1)`) and advanced percentage calculations (`100 + 10%`).
* **Modern UX/UI:** Clean, expressive interface built using Google's Material 3 design guidelines.
* **Advanced State Management:** Utilizes a decoupled `Controller-Engine` architecture for maintaining state, ensuring expressions, results, and cursor positions are stable across screen rotations and application restarts.
